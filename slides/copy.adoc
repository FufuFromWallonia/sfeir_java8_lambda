== Lambda expression

How to write, build and  use lambdas


== What is lambda expression?
Let's introduce this with some examples

== Example 1

----
include::../code/src/main/java/lu/sfeir/java8/lambda/anonymous/Sample1.java[tags=example1]
----

== Example 2

----
include::../code/src/main/java/lu/sfeir/java8/lambda/anonymous/Sample2.java[tags=example2]
----

== What did we do?
* We wrote some code in an anonymous class
* And we passed it to another piece of code
* That executed it "later"
* And in another context (thread)
* We passed code as a parameter
* And we used anonymous class, because it is the only way to do it in Java
